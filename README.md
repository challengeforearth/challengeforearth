**INTRODUCTION**

This project is now OPEN-SOURCE (and will be free for the eternity :-) ). You are free to fork it and develop your own based on mine, or you can just help me improve it, there is SO MUCH things to do, I have thousands of ideas ! Come on the Discord (link below), and we will talk about this.

**WHAT IS CHALLENGE FOR EARTH ?**

It's a mobile-friendly web app using Laravel (PHP) to help people to ***reduce their carbon footprint***, giving them journeys full of challenges, with gamification (XP, levels and badges). The challenges are partially or fully inspired by :
- **ADEME** (Environment and Energy Management Agency) 
- **Association Bilan Carbone** (Carbon Balance sheet Association)
- **Surfrider foundation**

We are on Discord too (French only actually, but we can open english threads if needed, obviously) => https://discord.gg/DfkbXgQYpa

**The API**

This API allow you, after getting the Token with a login route, to get all (or one) challenges and all (of one) journeys. You can now export the challenges to your OWN APP, without any effort ! Actually, the data are in french, but i'm pretty sure we can use language files to internationalize this (I'm just lack of time) !
